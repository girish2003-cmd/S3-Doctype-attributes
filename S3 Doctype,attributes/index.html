            <p> A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares),
                 which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well
                  as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies that are sold to investors through equity 
                  crowdfunding platforms. Investments are usually made with an investment strategy in mind.</p>
